# Bread Tech Modpack
The Bread Tech Modpack!

The idea is for it to be a community modpack--we vote on every mod before we add it (nearly).
## System Requirements

You should obviously be able to play vanilla Minecraft smoothly, but the modpack has been successfully playtested with 2GB of allocated RAM smoothly. The game version is 1.12.2. 

## Permissions

Free to download but if you want to run a server with it maybe ask us first (thanks!) We also optimized the pack for servers, so it shouldn't operate terribly. 

# Have fun!
